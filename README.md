# What is Snack-Time?
Snack-Time is a media player that tracks what has been watched, for how long, and what's next.
It uses files already on the PC.

* Think Netflix but with local (downloaded) files.
* Or popcorn-time but with local (downloaded) files.
* Or Kodi (Formaly known as XBMC)

Uses files from Sonarr and Radarr.

# Requierment

* Sonarr or/and Radarr
* RabbitMQ
* MpcHc
* Dotnet core 2.1

## Why not use Kodi
I preferns the use of SmoothVideo Project (SVP), the implementation that Kodi provies does not work as I want.

## Note
As of now this is just a playground and a opportunity to work with new stuff, like Blazor.
